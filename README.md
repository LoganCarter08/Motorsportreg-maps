# Motorsportreg-maps

The entire purpose of this program is to create maps of each event on Motorsportreg.com. I've been trying to figure out where I want to live in the coming years and I want to make sure I move someplace that has plenty of events. Motorsportreg is the best source of motorsports events so logically pulling data from them is ideal. 

Check out Heatmaps folder for premade heatmaps based on events within a 90 mile radius. Webpages folder has map markers for every event, but if multiple events are stacked in the same location only the last added will show up to click. 

*******************************
I have been notified by motorsportreg that they have an API and that this method is not suggested, so please do not run the getInitLinks() function without notifying them first. If API is something public I will update this program to use that instead.
